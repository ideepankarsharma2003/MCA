npx create-react-app my-app  

# Success! Created my-app at C:\Deepankar\MCA-semester01\OMC101 Full Stack Development\Unit 05 MERN stack\REACT_js\my-app
# Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
#     Starts the development server.

  npm run build
#     Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
#     Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
#     Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
#     and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

# We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-app
  npm start
