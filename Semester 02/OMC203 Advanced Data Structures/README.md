#### **Unit 2: Queue and Linked List**

- **Queues**: A linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Two primary representations of queues:
  - **Array Representation**: Queue is implemented using a fixed-size array. It can lead to inefficient use of memory when items are dequeued.
  - **Linked List Representation**: More efficient as it dynamically allocates memory and avoids the "queue full" situation.
  
  **Types of Queues**:
  - **Circular Queue**: A queue where the last element is connected back to the first element. This allows for efficient memory use by overcoming the limitations of the array representation.
  - **Dequeue (Double-ended Queue)**: A type of queue that allows insertion and deletion from both ends, making it more flexible than a regular queue.
  - **Priority Queue**: Elements are dequeued according to their priority, not just by the order of arrival.

- **Linked List**: A data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. Unlike arrays, linked lists are dynamic and can easily grow and shrink.
  - **Singly Linked List**: Each node has a data field and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. Insertion and deletion operations are easy but traversing is sequential and can be inefficient.
  - **Two-way Header List**: Contains an additional header node that holds information about the list, such as its size or reference to both the first and last nodes.
  - **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circular chain. This makes the list traversable from any point.
  - **Doubly Linked List**: Each node contains two pointers: one pointing to the next node and the other to the previous node. This allows traversal in both directions and facilitates easier deletion of nodes.

#### **Unit 3: Non-linear Data Structures**

- **General Trees**: A hierarchical data structure with a parent-child relationship. Each node can have multiple children, making it more complex than linear structures like arrays and linked lists.
  - **Operations on Trees**: Inserting nodes, deleting nodes, searching for specific nodes, and updating tree structures.
  
  **Tree Traversals**:
  - **Preorder Traversal**: Visit the root, then traverse the left subtree, followed by the right subtree.
  - **Inorder Traversal**: Traverse the left subtree first, visit the root, and then the right subtree. It is used to retrieve data in a sorted order for binary search trees.
  - **Postorder Traversal**: Traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree, and visit the root last.
  - **Level-order Traversal**: Visit nodes level by level, from top to bottom and left to right.

- **Binary Trees**: A special case of a tree where each node has at most two children (left and right). Common operations include:
  - **Insertion**: Adding nodes to the tree while maintaining its structure.
  - **Deletion**: Removing nodes and re-arranging the tree to maintain balance.
  - **Balancing**: Ensuring that the tree remains balanced to optimize search operations.

- **Conversion of General Tree to Binary Tree**: A technique to convert a general tree into a binary tree, where the left child points to the first child and the right child points to the sibling.

- **Huffman’s Algorithm**: A greedy algorithm used for data compression, reducing the size of files by encoding more frequent characters with shorter codes and less frequent characters with longer codes.

- **Applications of Trees**:
  - Used in file systems (directory structures), expression parsing (expression trees), databases (B-trees and B+ trees), and network routing algorithms.

#### **Unit 4: Graphs**

- **Introduction to Graphs**: A graph is a set of vertices connected by edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, cyclic or acyclic.
  
  **Graph Traversal Algorithms**:
  - **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Explores nodes layer by layer, visiting all the nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It’s useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
  - **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It’s used in applications like topological sorting, cycle detection, and solving puzzles.

- **Spanning Tree**: A subgraph of a graph that connects all vertices together without any cycles.
  - **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: A spanning tree with the minimum possible total edge weight.
  - **Kruskal’s Algorithm**: A greedy algorithm that finds the MST by sorting the edges and adding the shortest edge while avoiding cycles.
  - **Prim’s Algorithm**: Another greedy algorithm for MST that grows a tree one vertex at a time by adding the shortest edge connecting a vertex in the tree to one outside the tree.

- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: A dynamic programming algorithm used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph.

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: A greedy algorithm used to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

#### **Unit 5: Algorithm**

- **Growth of Functions**: Measures how the resource requirements (time or space) of an algorithm grow with the size of the input.
  
  **Asymptotic Notations**:
  - **Big-O Notation (O)**: Describes the upper bound on the time complexity of an algorithm, representing the worst-case scenario.
  - **Theta Notation (Θ)**: Describes the exact asymptotic behavior, giving a tight bound on time complexity.
  - **Omega Notation (Ω)**: Describes the lower bound on the time complexity, representing the best-case scenario.

- **Algorithm Complexity**: Evaluates how the runtime and space requirements of an algorithm scale with input size, categorized as constant, logarithmic, linear, polynomial, exponential, etc.

#### **Unit 6: Sorting**

- **Sorting**: The process of arranging data in a particular order, usually ascending or descending. Common sorting algorithms include:
  - **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements that are out of order. Simple but inefficient for large datasets.
  - **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by comparing elements and shifting them into the correct position.
  - **Selection Sort**: Repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
  - **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the array into two halves, and recursively sorts the partitions. It’s efficient and widely used in practice.
  - **Merge Sort**: Divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges them back together. It’s a stable and efficient algorithm, particularly for large datasets.

#### **Unit 7: Advanced Searching Algorithms**

- **Advanced Searching Techniques**: These include efficient data search mechanisms like balanced trees, AVL trees, and heaps.
  
  **Search Tree Traversals**:
  - Similar to binary tree traversal, but optimized for search trees, including in-order traversal for retrieving sorted data.

- **Threaded Binary Search Trees**: A type of binary search tree where null pointers are replaced with links to the inorder predecessor or successor, speeding up traversal.

- **Inserting and Deleting Nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Efficient algorithms to maintain the order of the tree during insertion and deletion of nodes.

- **Height Balanced (AVL) Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between left and right subtrees is at most one. AVL trees are useful for maintaining fast search times.

- **Heap**:
  - **Min Heap**: The parent node is smaller than or equal to its children, and the minimum element is at the root.
  - **Max Heap**: The parent node is larger than or equal to its children, and the maximum element is at the root.
  - Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues and for heap sort.

#### **Unit 8: Hashing**

- **Hashing Techniques**: Hashing is used to store and retrieve data efficiently using a hash function to map data to a specific index in an array (hash table).
  - **Hash Function**: Converts input (key) into a fixed-size integer, which is the index where the value will be stored in the hash table.
  
  **Collision Resolution Techniques**:
  - **Linear Probing**: When a collision occurs, the next available slot is used sequentially.
  - **Double Hashing**: Uses a second hash function to determine how far to move in case of a collision, improving efficiency.
  
- **Bucket Addressing**: Grouping multiple keys into the same bucket in the hash table.
- **Rehashing**: When the hash table becomes too full, a larger table is created, and existing elements are reinserted.

#### **Unit 9: File Structures**

- **Records**: A group of related fields treated as a single data unit.
  
  **File Operations**: 
  - **Create**: Defining and initializing a new file.
  - **Update**: Modifying existing records within a file.
  - **Delete**: Removing records from a file.



- **File System Organization**:
  - **Sequential File Organization**: Records are stored and accessed sequentially.
  - **Relative File Organization**: Records are stored based on their relative position.
  - **Indexed File Organization**: Indexes are used to facilitate quick searches for records.
  - **Random Access Mode**: Records can be accessed directly using their address.

- **Direct Mapping Techniques**:
  - **Absolute Mapping**: Each record has a unique fixed position.
  - **Relative Mapping**: Records are stored relative to a base address.
  - **Indexed Sequential File Access Method (ISAM)**: Combines sequential access with an index for faster searches.

#### **Unit 10: Indexed Structures**

- **Binary Search Trees (BSTs) as Indexes**: Using BSTs to index data for faster searching and retrieval.

- **M-way Search Trees**: A generalization of binary trees where each node can have more than two children, allowing for faster search operations in large datasets.

- **B-trees**: A self-balancing search tree in which nodes can have multiple children. It’s used in databases and file systems to efficiently store and retrieve large blocks of data.
  - **Operations**: Searching, inserting, and deleting elements while maintaining balance.
  
- **B+ Trees**: A variation of B-trees, where all records are stored at the leaf level, and internal nodes only store keys. It is widely used in database indexing.
